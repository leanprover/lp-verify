  User-facing verified-solve driver: the `Verified` / `VerifiedSolve`
  data types and the pure `Solution → Verified` mapping `verifyOutcome`.

  `verifyOutcome` is pure Lean. Solver backends call it after
  producing an `LPCore.Solution`; this module has no native or
  backend dependency of its own.

/-! ## Sense-canonicalization is feasibility-invariant.

  `canonicalize` only touches `c` and `objOffset`; `IsFeasible` does
  not. So `IsFeasible (canonicalize sense p) x ↔ IsFeasible p x` by
  `rfl` once `sense` is destructured. Used below to repackage
  `checkOptimal_sound`'s feasibility component (which is stated
  about the canonicalized LP) into the `IsFeasible normalized x`
  shape that `Verified.optimal` demands. -/

/-- Pure mapping from a `Solution` (whatever produced it) to a
    `Verified` proof carrier. Every failure path returns
    `Verified.unchecked _`; the three positive constructors are only
    built from real soundness-lemma conclusions, never fabricated.

    Failure paths, in order:

    1. Budget overrun (`denomBudget = some n` and the certificate's
       rationals exceed `n` bits) → `.unchecked .budgetExceeded`,
       checked **before** any `check*` runs.
    2. Non-terminal solver status (`timeLimit`, `iterLimit`,
       `numericFailure`, `aborted`, `budgetExceeded`) → passed
       through as `.unchecked status`.
    3. Missing certificate field for a terminal status (e.g.
       `.optimal` but no `dual`) → `.unchecked status`.
    4. Failed `check*` → `.unchecked status`.

    The downstream `check*` runs against the canonicalized LP, which
    is `negateObjective normalized` for `.maximize`. -/
